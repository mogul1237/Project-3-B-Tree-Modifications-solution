This project will make modifications to an existing B+ Tree implementation. You can
clone the code base from: https://github.com/fwmiller/bpt When you are
finished, you will create a diff file between your solution and the original source tree.
This diff file is what you will submit to Moodle.
The code is written in straight C and there is a simple Makefile included. If you are not
familiar with C, you will need to tutor yourself to be able to read this codebase.
This code base has a Command Line Interface (CLI) built into it. The CLI is scriptable
and we will use test scripts to test your code. A sample test script will be published on
Moodle.
This project will use interview grading. 40% of your grade will be based on the
submitted materials. The remaining 60% will come from the interview portion. You
must schedule an interview slot with a grader. If you do not schedule or attend a slot the
interview portion will be scored zero.
Procedure
You are to change the code such that keys are maintained in the data structure in
descending order rather than ascending order. Note you are modifying the order that
things are sorted in, not the max number of keys per node (which is referred to the order
of the tree).
1. Understand the code base
Look at the global data structures: struct record and struct node. The
important functions form three groups: utility, insertion, and deletion. Your
changes should not affect the operation of the program, i.e. all CLI commands
should work as before. The tree will just be maintained and output in a different
sorted order.
You should also be able to specify the tree order number (i.e. the max number of
keys per node) the same way as before your changes.
2. Plan you modifications
Once you have an idea about how the code works, plan the changes you want to
make.
3. Execute the modifications in a manageable sequence
If you have a set of modifications you want to make, try to do them in a logical
order. I would also recommend adding, compiling and testing your changes
incrementally.
4. Create and submit your diff file
The easiest thing to do here is to cd to the root of your repository and issue the git
diff command and vector the output to a file, e.g.
% git diff > test
This will dump the output of git diff into a file called test that you can submit to
Moodle.
5. Be able to discuss all the changes you made to the code based on your diff and
why
The intent of the assignment is to understand and modify appropriately an existing code
base that implements an important indexing data structure. Also, if you are not familiar
with any of the tools discussed in this assignment, e.g. git, diff, you are responsible for
coming up to speed on them.
The best student solution(s)1 may be published as samples.
